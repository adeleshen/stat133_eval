# Small Batch Tiramisu

### Ingredients
- 24 ladyfingers (savioardi) cookies
- 3 large eggs, separated
- 1/3 cup (65 grams) plus 1 tablespoon (13 grams) granulated sugar, divided
- 1 8.8-ounce (250 ml) package mascarpone
- 1/3 cup (80 ml) sweet or dry marsala
- 1 cup (235 ml) strong, warm espresso coffee
- A couple tablespoons of your favorite cocoa powder, for sifting over

### Kitchen Tools needed
* egg beater
* small cups
* large cups

### Steps
1. Beat egg whites until stiff.
2. Beat egg yolks and 1/3 cup sugar until thick and pale yellow, 3 to 4 minutes. 
3. Beat in mascarpone cheese until combined and fluffy. 
4. Beat in marsala until smooth. 
5. Gently fold in egg whites until combined, trying not to deflate the mixture. 
6. In a small bowl wide enough to dip cookies into, combine the espresso and 1 tablespoon sugar. Set aside.
7. To assemble small cups: Dip cookie in espresso mixture, break in half and place the first half in the bottom of your cup. Spoon 1 tablespoon cream over it. Repeat with second half of first biscuit and another spoonful of cream. Dust with cocoa powder. Dip second cookie in coffee and break in half. Place side-by-side over cocoa then top with 2 tablespoons cream mixture. Dust with more cocoa. Repeat with remaining cups.
8. To assemble large cups: Dip cookie in espresso mixture. Break in half and place side-by-side in the bottom of cup. Spoon 2 tablespoons cream over and dust with cocoa powder. Dip two biscuits in espresso mixture and break in half. Place 3 of the halves on top of the cocoa powder, cover with 2 tablespoons of cream and cocoa powder. Dip a 4th biscuit in the espresso mixture, break in half, and place two halves plus the half from the previous layer on top of the cocoa. Dollop more cream over and repeat with remaining cups.
9. Let cups chill in fridge overnight to set.

# Euclidean Distance
Definition
-------------------
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them (**$\bar{p}$$\bar{q}$**).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p1, p2*,..., *pn*) and **q** = (*q1, q2*,..., *qn*) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$d\left ( \boldsymbol{p}, \mathbf{q} \right )$ = $d\left ( \boldsymbol{q}, \mathbf{p} \right )$ = $\sqrt{\left ( q_{1}-p_{1} \right )^2+\left ( q_{2}-p_{2} \right )^2+...+\left ( q_{n}-p_{n} \right )^2}$

= $\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left ( q_{i}-p_{i} \right )^2}$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$\left \| \mathbf{p}\right \|$ = $\sqrt{p_{1}^2+p_{2}^2+...+p_{n}^2}$ = $\sqrt{\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{p}}$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
