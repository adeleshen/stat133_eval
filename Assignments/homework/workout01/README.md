The purpose of this assignment is twofold. On one hand, we keep working with data.frames, subsetting and summarizing data, as well as creating visualizations of data. We implement more complex file structure. On the other hand, we analyze the data we extracted and create a meaningful narrative. 

This workout involves visualizing shot data of NBA players, producing shot charts for 5 players from the Golden State Warriors, as well as other summaries and tables such as for effective shooting percentage by player. Finally, there is a 1000-word article that synthesizes data extracted.
