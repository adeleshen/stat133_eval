The purpose of this assignment is twofold. On one hand, we keep working with functions and conditionals. On the other hand, we learn to create a shiny app where we can interact with the data to create different scenarios. 

This workout involves the savings functions from warmup06, and a shiny app with slider and input widgets, which then generates a timeline plot and a table. With this app, one can see the effects of investments varying in principal and rates with no, fixed, or growing contributions.
