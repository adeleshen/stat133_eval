The purpose of this exercise was to evaluate my R skills in a face-to-face setting. With only cheat sheets as resources, this tested my grasp of the material covered in this course and mastery of data.frame basics, loop and RegEx concepts, and plotting abilities. In addition to the files created, my bash skills were also evaluated in creating and moving folders and files.
